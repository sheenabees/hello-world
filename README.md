first repository

Hello World! This is Sheenabees. I wish I knew about GitHub while in graduate school when I first learned coding.
Oh man, it would have saved me SO MUCH time and probably would have been a lot less messy than the version control I created for myself
But it's never too late. I'm learning now!
